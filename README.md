# Dealership Architecture Capstone Project

This project showcases the creation of a comprehensive **dealership architecture** with the following key components:

- **Dealership Landing Page**: A fully deployed webpage where users can view and interact with dealership information.
- **"About Us" Section**: A dedicated section that provides a detailed background of the dealership.
- **Full CRUD Functionality**: Enables users to **create**, **read**, **update**, and **delete** dealership records seamlessly.
- **Database Integration**: The project integrates with a relational database to manage dealership records efficiently.
- **API Integration**: The architecture includes endpoints for interacting with the backend via **RESTful API** methods.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Used for backend development.
- **Flask**: Handles the web server logic and routing.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend structure and styling.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity to the webpage.
- **PostgreSQL**: Manages the relational database for storing dealership records.
- **Docker**: Used to containerize the project, ensuring a consistent environment.


## Key Features

- **Landing Page**: A visually appealing webpage displaying the dealershipâ€™s inventory, with options to filter and search for vehicles.
- **Inventory Management**: Backend support for managing car inventory, including options for **adding**, **updating**, **deleting**, and **viewing** cars.
- **Search and Filtering**: Users can search cars by make, model, or year and filter the inventory based on various criteria.
- **Admin Panel**: Allows admin users to manage dealership and inventory records securely.
